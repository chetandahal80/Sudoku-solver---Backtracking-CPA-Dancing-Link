# Sudoku-solver with image processing and multiple solving techniques---Backtracking-CPA-Dancing-Link

## Introduction
This repository presents a comprehensive solution for resolving Sudoku puzzles using advanced solving methods and image processing. A Sudoku picture is processed by the system, which then extracts and identifies the digits. One of four implemented algorithms—simple backtracking, CPA (Constraint Propagation Algorithm), DLX (Dancing Links), and an optimized DLX—is then used to solve the problem.
