# Sudoku-solver with image processing and multiple solving techniques---Backtracking-CPA-Dancing-Link

## Introduction
This repository presents a comprehensive solution for resolving Sudoku puzzles using advanced solving methods and image processing. A Sudoku picture is processed by the system, which then extracts and identifies the digits. One of four implemented algorithms—simple backtracking, CPA (Constraint Propagation Algorithm), DLX (Dancing Links), and an optimized DLX — can be used to solve the problem.

## Features
* Image Processing: Extracts individual cells from the given sudoku image.
  
* Digit Recognition: Uses a CNN model to recognize digits from processed cell images.
  
* Solving techniques: Includes simple backtracking, CPA, DLX or optimized DLX algorithm.
  
* Efficient Execution: Optimized DLX algorithm avoids the creation of binary matrix for faster operation.
